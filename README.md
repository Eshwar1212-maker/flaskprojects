# Python/Flask Projects
This repository is a collection of small Python/Flask projects aimed at understanding these technologies better.
I have a heavy Nodejs background, and as someone learning Python, I thought I would make this repo to help guide others
transitioning to the language. 

# List of concepts we Will aim to learn in this repo:

## External API's
All of these projects will connect to external API's. The purpose of this is to understand how backend systems work 
and deal with important concepts like security, webhooks, rate limiting, etc. If you 

## Core Python concepts

Another thing I really wanted to cover in this repo and collection of projects is the main core Python concepts every 
engineer should have a strong grasp of. You will learn how these concepts are applied and used in real world codebases. 

### Decorators

### Advanced OOP

### Inheritance

### Webhooks

### Scalability
Even though all of these projects will be small. We will implement scalable architecture that is commonly seen in 
Python/Flash applications. This will involve creating a scalable folder/file structure, as well as having readable
modular functions all throughout.


# Projects we will work on
You might be wondering what projects we will we be working on in the first place? Good question:

## Twilio video application

This project will connect to the Twilio API, creating a video web application with a Python3/Flask backend.
